# Day-Planner

# User Story
As a full-time employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively

# How it Works
The planner will display the current day at the top with standard business hour slots underneath. The past hours will be gray, present will be red and future will be green and this should change depending on the time of day. Each slot will be for one hour and allow you to input any activities or appointments. 

Once you input content in the textbox, you will have to click 'Save' for it to store the content in the local storage.
When you refresh the page, the text inputted will be saved to the time slot. You will be able to edit your planner but remember to click save for it to be stored.
